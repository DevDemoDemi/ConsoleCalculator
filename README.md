### Getting started:
To use this calculator, load the corresponding HTML file in your browser. Once loaded, hit F12 and click on Console. Directions will immediately appear. To calculate a problem, type `calc(a, b, operate);` with any value from 1 to 9 (either as an integer, number as a string, or word in any casing) for arguments `a` and `b` and any operator as a string `""` using either the symbol (+, -, *, /) or a string of words related to the operator ("add", "sub", "times", "divided by", etc.) for the `operate`.
Ex. `calc(1, "oNE", "add");` will return "The sum of 1 and 1 is 2."
